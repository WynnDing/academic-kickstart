abstract: "Predicting student learning outcomes is one of the prominent themes in Learning Analytics research. These studies varied to a significant extent in terms of the techniques being used, the contexts in which they were situated, and the consequent effectiveness of the prediction. This paper presented the preliminary results of a systematic review of studies in predictive learning analytics. With the goal to find out what methodologies work for what circumstances, this study will be able to facilitate future research in this area, contributing to relevant system developments that are of pedagogic values."
